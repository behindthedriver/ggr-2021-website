[Getting Started](/autocross/first-timers/)

Autocross is a great way to start exploring the performance and road-handling capabilities of your Porsche in a safe, fast and fun environment. The course is laid out with traffic cones in a large parking lot. Turns are designed with varying degree of sharpness such that the best times result from superior driving skills, rather than horsepower.

The rules are simple: go as fast as you can without knocking over any cones. At the end of each run, your time is recorded, and a one second penalty is added for each cone you knocked down. In a typical day, you will get 10 to 12 runs. In the morning you will probably concentrate on learning the course, and in the afternoon show what you are made of.
