First off, you need to be at least 18 years of age and currently own or lease a Porsche.  And you must have a membership in the PCA.  You can join at www.pca.org/join-porsche-club-america.

That costs $46 per year, which then allows you to become a regional member – at no additional cost. When signing up, you can choose to join GGR at that time and you may also enroll a family member (relative) or affiliate member (friend) for free.  However, if you live outside the San Francisco Bay Area, you should visit the region directory to determine the region closest to you.

Membership in the PCA also provides you with the opportunity to talk with people who own and drive the same kind of car you do. It provides contacts for Porsche related services in our area.  As part of your membership, you will receive PCA’s outstanding monthly national magazine, Panorama. Members also can place ads for free in Panorama, and on the classifieds section of the GGR web site to buy or sell Porsche related goods.

With over 108,000+ members, the PCA is divided into 14 zones across the US and Canada. Those zones are further divided into 144 geographical regions. The Golden Gate Region, in Zone 7, is one of the nation’s largest and most active of the PCA’s regions.

Badges

Member badges will be provided free to all those who RSVP and attend “new member” social and some track events. Otherwise, member badges are available for a small fee through Spotlight Impressions in San Mateo.  The badges feature the GGR logo, your name and a convenient magnetic clasp. The cost is $12.00 for the badge plus shipping.   To order your badges fill out the form and email back to Spotlight Impressions at sales@spotlightimpressions.com.



GGR now has its own clothing line! The online logo store features a superlative selection of GGR-logo’d men and women’s clothing in a wide range of sizes and colors.  The GGR Webstore is located on the PCA website.  Just log in and create an account to get shopping.

GGR also uses some popular “Social Media” websites to help us stay in touch with our members. So, if you’re inclined, when you join,  please “like” Golden Gate Region PCA on Facebook or “Follow” @PCAGGR on Twitter!

New Ideas and Volunteers

We look forward to working with you in the years to come.  We’re always open to new ideas to better the club so please let us know if you have any suggestions or thoughts that we might take into consideration.  To that end, we have created a survey that we’d like to have you take to get your input on what you expect from your membership.  When you have the time, please take it and help us make GGR even better – Here is a link to the survey: www.surveymonkey.com/s/85KY3PS.

And finally, when you become a member, we’d like you to sign up for the GGR Announce Mailing List so you’ll receive up-to-the-minute club info pushed directly to you.  Go to Connect with GGR to sign up, if you’d like. 

I’m looking forward to meeting you soon. If you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer them.  Contact me anytime by email and remember, if you think you’re having fun with your car now wait until you join us!
